# Naive-Bees-Prediction
A model that can automatically detect honey bees and bumble bees in images.
Project Tasks:
1. Import Python libraries
2. Display image of each bee type
3. Image manipulation with rgb2grey
4. Histogram of oriented gradients
5. Create image features and flatten into a single row
6. Loop over images to preprocess
7. Scale feature matrix + PCA
8. Split into train and test sets
9. Train model
10. Score model
11. ROC curve + AUC
